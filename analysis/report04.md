# Cryptography
## Before
Describe in a few sentences what the actual status is (before changing).
## After
Describe in a few sentences what you
- kept in your project
- changed in your project
(explain how you found it, and why you kept/changed it)
## Code Examples
Mention here wat parts of the code you changed (referencing exact class/file-name and code lines)

# Injections
(maximum a half A4-page of text, code snippets and screenshots not included)

## Before
Describe in a few sentences what the actual status is (before changing).
## After
Describe in a few sentences what you
- kept in your project
- changed in your project
(explain how you found it, and why you kept/changed it)
(if frameworks, libraries already provide defense mechanisms, please explain how and what they actually do)
## Code Examples
Mention here wat parts of the code you changed (referencing exact class/file-name and code lines)


# Class 04 Vulnerable & Outdated components

## SBOM & Dependency Check
Describe in a few sentences how you generated you SBOM, incl. the tools you used and the issues you encountered. 
Describe in a few sentences how you checked if you used vulnerable dependencies. 

## Vulnerabilities 
List here the vulnerabilities you have found in direct dependencies or transitive dependencies. 
Refer to the SBOM in appendix (don't put it in here).

## Vulnerabilities - Updated
What vulnerabilities were you able to mitigate (by upgrading) and why did you choose to do so?
What vulnerabilities did you keep (and why)?


# Class 05/06/07 - Authentication, Session Management & Authorization
(guideline: max 2 A4 pages, images/code snippets not counted)
Describe each of the following functionalities in your application AS IS: 
- user registration & user removal
- user authentication 
- password forgotten
- change password 
- session management (Stateful or Stateless, how session information is being created, stored and transferred, where do you access it, where do you verify it, how do you terminate it, ...). Also include screenshot(s) of the whole cookie/token/header (so I can clearly see all properties and the value).
- access control (what roles, permissions, ... do you have and how and where do you check them, but also do you enable CORS and/or CSP and/or CSRF and how did you configure it)

For the functionalities you did not have yet, implement them. Or if not feasible, describe how you would implement them but why it's not feasible for you. When evaluating this, based on what we saw in class, did you improve your functionalities or code? If so, please explain what you changed and why.

How did you test/check for vulnerabilities? 
Were you able to perform any kind of session attack or access control on your application?

# Appendix
## Tools used
Mention here all the tools/libraries you used for improving the security.
Provide me (in appendix) with at least one pentest report.

## Vulnerabilities discovered
Put here the full list of CVE's you found that were applicable to your code (or the libraries you used)

## Most interesting conversation with a GenAI tool
Here, I expect you to copy paste a full transcript of the most interesting conversation you had with a genAI tool (also mention which one and what version).
